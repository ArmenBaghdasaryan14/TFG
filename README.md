Design of an unmanned aerial vehicle with a mass-actuated control system

As a Bachelor of Science thesis, this project involves different fields of aerospace engineering. The main goal was to analize, design and evaluate a blended-wing-body unmanned aerial vehicle with an innovative control system, without aerodynamic flight-control surfaces. The aircraft has a system of movable masses which can be actuated to alter the center of mass position on longitudinal and lateral axis. The main purpose of the control system is to provide static and dynamic stability
throughout the flight envelope, maneuvers and to counter wind gusts.

The main advantage of this implementation is an improvement on the performance, since drag can be considerably reduced during maneuvers. Furthermore, maintenance cost can be significantly reduced since the mechanical components involved in the control system have less complexity and no expensive actuators are required.

An advanced aerodynamic design for a flying-wing configuration is proposed, where diverse s-shaped airfoils have been combined providing high efficiency. From a structural point of view, the aircraft, in overall, is more robust since only internal components are mobile. Throughout the thesis, both, analytical and numerical methods have been considered and applied for the design and verification. Regarding the testing of the control system, different flight control algorithms have been generated and a series of simulations for dynamic cases have been done (with vertical wind gust), with satisfying results.
